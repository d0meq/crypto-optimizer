This project is a tool for analyzing and optimizing investment portfolios based on historical stock data. It uses various financial metrics and optimization techniques to help users make informed investment decisions.

## Features

- Fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
- Generate demo data if real data is unavailable
- Calculate key portfolio metrics (mean returns, covariance matrix, annual returns, annual volatility)
- Optimize portfolios using Markowitz model
- Calculate efficient frontier
- Perform Monte Carlo simulations
- Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
- Visualize portfolio composition and risk metrics
